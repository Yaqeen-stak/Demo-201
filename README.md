# Demo-201
In this project er are going to crieat a web pag that helps the user to know more about us .
first of all we would like to say welcome to the user , so we asked him to add his name so we replay with welcome msg.
then ,we will ask him 5 quastions and he must answer with yes or no only .
then we asked him ao add a number he guess we are thinking about.he has only limit time of trying! and we helped him with a msg. that told him if he is near or far to the answer.
also, we asked him to know a new information about us .also he has a limited time to try.
Finally ,we told him the score that he got in the game ,so we let him enter to the site and read some information about us .
...
we uesd JS to add the quastions and we used for,while,if and switch statments.
we used CSS to style the pag.
and we linked both files to the HTML index.

* We added functions to the logic or our game.
* Navigator: Yaqeen Hmad.
* Driver: Batool Malkawi.
